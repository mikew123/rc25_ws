# RoboColumbus2025
Wheeled autonomus robot for 2025 DPRG RoboColumbus competion

This project was started in June 2024 and is expected to have a competitive robot for the RoboColumbus competition in Fall of 2025. I will drive the robot around the field in The Fall of 2024 and maybe have odometry and mapping displayed using ROS2 Rviz2.

# RoboColumbus competition
The basic objective for RoboColumbus are:
-Three orange cones, designated as home, target, and challenge, are placed
outdoors approximately 100 yards from each other. The course between the home cone and the
target cone is clear of obstacles. The course between the challenge cone to both the home
cone and the target cone contains at least one obstacle that requires the robot to deviate from a
direct path. The challenge is to touch and stop at each cone.
- If multiple contestants find and touch the same number of cones then the total time is used to select the winner.
- Robots run on a field of grasses and some tree/bushes boxes etc for obsticles to avoid. Some pavement is OK.
- GPS coordinates of the 3 traffic cones in the field are provided. There should be obsticals between some of the cones. The owner can create GPS coordinates to avoid obsticles.
- The cones are orange and about 17" high and 7" diameter.
- Robots are NOT allowed on the field before competition.
- Run times are less than 15 Minutes
- Robots checked for weight(65 lbs), size(48x48x60 in), and safety switch compliance.

# Robot platform
The AXIAL RCX6 1/6 scale Jeep rock crawler platform was selected to be used for the robot. This platform allows generous room for sensors and electronics to be added and can be installed into the interior of the Jeep for protection.

The motor drive, steering and shift control signals must be multiplexed between the RC receiver and the computer. A module in the engine compartment will be added to perform this with a serial interface to the computer in the Jeep cabin. The RC receiver is powered from the motor controller (facrory default) and the connections to the computer is optional, the module will power up to use the RC receiver signals.

The main battery in the engine compartment will also be used for sensors and computer power. A DC-DC module would be added in the engine compartment with 2 sets of 5V at 3 Amps power leads to the Jeep cabin. Fusing the power from the main battery is added for protection. The control multiplexor and DC converter on one board.

# Electronic modules
## Servo switch
This switches the servo and engine ESC signals between the RC receiver and the computer</br>

## DC-DC converter
This supplies power for the cabin electronics. The 6V allows a protection diode while keeping the voltage above 5V</br>

## Level shifter
This protects the 3.3V input pins on the micro controller from the 6V signals from the RC receiver</br>

## Microcontroller
This selects between the computer in the cabin and the RC receiver. It also relays the steering, throttle and shift signals from the computer and the servos and motor ESC. It also allows the computer to set default ranges etc, and sends statuses back.</br>

# New electronics in engine compartment
A waterproof box is mounted to the rear battery holder. This box holds the DC-DC converters for the electronics in the cabin, the servo signal mux and a micro controller to manage the servo switch and send some telemetry to the computer in the cabin. The servo switch defaults to connecting the RC receiver to the motor and servos.</br>

## Method to switch to computer control
The steering wheel and speed switch on the RC transmitter is used to switch to-from computer control. This must be done with throttle at idle.
- Switch to computer control: Turn steering left (CCW) and press speed switch DN(high) then UP (low)
- Switch to receiver control: Turn steering right and press speed switch DN then UP
## Electronics board
The electronic modules are connected using soldered wires and a 0.1" breadboard cut to fit the waterproff box interior
The RC receiver signals are connected to the MASTER pins of the RC switch module using standard servo cables
The motor and servo signals are connected to the OUT pins of the RC switch module using standard servo cables
The controler pins are hard wired to the SLAVE pins of the RC switch
The controller USB supplies the power only to the micro controller</br>
The DC-DC converters are inside the waterproof box. The power input from the battery has an in-line fuse which is not in the box to protect the batteries from an electrical short.</br>

# Micro controller firmware
The microcontroller firmware is C-code developed using the Arduino IDE. The interface to the controller uses the USB port for a serial communications interface. A simple Json data structure sends data to-from the computer in the cabin over the USB serial interface.
## RC switch interface
### Outputs to RC switch
- Slave select
- Steering servo
- Motor speed/fwd-rev
- High-Low speed select servo
### Inputs from RC switch
- Steering
- High-Low speed select
## Decode RC receiver Steer and Shift PWm signals
### Switch to/from computer control
- From receiver<br>
Enable computer control: Steering CW, toggle Shift DOWN then UP<br>
Enable receiver control: Steering CCW, toggle Shift DOWN the UP<br>
- From computer<br>
Send JSON message<br>
## JSON messages
### Congfigure messages from the computer
- Switch to/from computer control<br>
{"rc":bool} Select signal source, RC receiver true, USB computer false<br>
- Failsafe enable/disable<br>
{"fse":bool} Failsafe enabled, enabled true, disabled false<br>
### Runtime control messages from computer
The throttle and steer commands will be send to motors when the remote trigger is pulled while failsafe is enabled (default enabled)<br>
When powered on the throttle and steering are from the receiver. They can be switched to the computer with a JSON command or from controls on the receiver<br>
- Throttle<br>
{"thr":pct} percent throttle, forward +pct, reverse -pct<br>
- Steer<br>
{"str":pct} percent steering, right +pct, left -pct<br>
- Gear shift<br>
{"sft":bool} Gear shift, high true, low false<br>
### Status messages to computer
## Throttle bidir half duplex serial messages
The Throttle interface between the RC receiver and the ESC controller is a bidirectional UART serial interface at 155200 baud. The RC receiver sends control signals to the ESC. The ESC responds with telemetry data to the RC receiver.<br>
The devices power on with the RC <-> ESC Throttle in BYPASS mode, the Zero can disable BYPASS and receive the serial data from both the RC and the ESC. The Zero can enable serial TX to both the RC and ESC between RX messages to impliment the half duplex.<br>

# Velocity control

The Spektrum ESC motor speed control is in percent throttle. It seems like any Throttle value less than 21 does not activate the motor so the range seems to be about 20 to 100 where 20 is 0 RPM. Reverse seems to be about the same -20 to -100.<br>
An early test plot of Throttle vs Rpm and Velocity(M/S):<br>

<img src="support/Test scripts/test_plot.png"></br>
The sample rate is 10Hz and there are 10 values for each throtthe value 20 to 100<br>
Throttle is not scaled but offset by 20 so the plot range is 0 to 80 for actual values of 20% to 100%. Velocity Mps is scaled by 100 to graph well. Motor Rpm is scaled by 0.055.<br>
The motor RPM extracted from the ESC telemetry as basically linear with Throttle but has steps so is not very usable. The Velocity Meters/Second is very linear with Throttle except at the upper throttle values above 90% (70 on plot) where it tapers off a bit. The velocity has some noise, it might be caused by the "bumps" on the omni wheel of the GoBuilda Pod Wheel encoder that I used measure the rottaion of the drive shaft by pressing against it.<br>
The plotted velocity Mps was calculated as (millisDiff/1000)/(odomDiff/5,615). The scale factor of 5,615 was determined my measuring the circumference of the tire (~570mm) and reading the odom encoder change after the tire rotates 10 times. (The throttle was set to 25% and the time it was running tweaked to get exactly 10 rotations.)<br>
